[2646 Minimize the Total Price of the Trips](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimize-the-total-price-of-the-trips/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about Tree DFS.

#### 1.Simple

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotalPrice(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], price: List[int], trips: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        def dfs(start, end, visited):
            visited.append(start)
            normal_price = price[start]
            cut_price = price[start]//2
            for neighbor in graph[start]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    if neighbor==end:
                        normal_price += price[neighbor]//2
                        cut_price += price[neighbor]
                    else:
                        np, cp = dfs(neighbor, end, visited)
                        normal_price += cp
                        cut_price += np
            return normal_price, cut_price
        
        ans = 0
        for trip in trips:
            ans += min(dfs(trip[0], trip[1], []))
            print(ans)
        return ans

```

_At first, I think this is a normal deep find search problem with greedy, however when I finish the code, I realized that this method can not ensure that the discount strategy of current trip may be not fit to others._

_According to [灵茶山艾府](https://leetcode.cn/u/endlesscheng/), I figure out how to solve the problem difficultly. We use dfs in two parts, first use dfs to find the contribution of each node to the cost (which means how many times do we pass each node), and so we can calculate the cost to judge which discount strategy is the best_
