[2661 First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://leetcode.cn/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about Hash.

#### 1.Simple

```python
class Solution:
    def firstCompleteIndex(self, arr: List[int], mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pos = {}
        for i in range(len(mat)):
            for j in range(len(mat[0])):
                pos[mat[i][j]] = (i, j)
        row = [0]*len(mat)
        col = [0]*len(mat[0])
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            row[pos[arr[i]][0]] += 1
            col[pos[arr[i]][1]] += 1
            if row[pos[arr[i]][0]]==len(mat[0]):
                return i
            if col[pos[arr[i]][1]]==len(mat):
                return i
        return -1
```

Firstly, I think the problem is to find the minimum index position of the element, which is on the crossing of a row and a column both are full filled. But the problem only requests to find the index of a row or a col which is full filled, so we only need to find the first full-filled row or column. Hash is fit for this kind of problem. Using two lists to record the filled count of each row and column, when full, return
