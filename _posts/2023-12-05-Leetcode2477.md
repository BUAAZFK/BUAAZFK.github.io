[2477 Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-fuel-cost-to-report-to-the-capital/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about Tree DFS.

#### 1.Simple

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumFuelCost(self, roads: List[List[int]], seats: int) -> int:
        # Firstly, we should know that for each path, if count of its previous number is larger than seats, then ceil(count/seats) is needed.
        # so we count the size of each subtree.
        # why +1? because the zero node is npc
        graph = [[] for _ in range(len(roads)+1)]
        for x, y in roads:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)

        ans = 0
        def dfs(x: int, father_node: int) -> int:
            size = 1
            for y in graph[x]:
                # judge if the neighbor is current node x's father node
                if y!=father_node:
                    size += dfs(y, x)
            if x:
                nonlocal ans
                ans += ceil(size/seats)
            return size
        dfs(0, -1)
        return ans
```

_The key problem of this question is to confirm how much oil is needed from each node to root. Then can be simplified to calculate the cost between each node and its father node, which equals to calculate the cost on each edge._

_we can summarize the rules, the cost of each edge is equal to the ceil of total number of child nodes/seats._
