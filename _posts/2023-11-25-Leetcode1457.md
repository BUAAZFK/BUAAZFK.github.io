[1457 Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.cn/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about DFS and Palindromic

#### 1.DFS

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        # counter = {}
        # counter is used to record the number of each number on one path
        counter = [0]*10
        return self.dfs(root, counter)

    def isPseudoPalindromic(self, counter):
        # record number of odd value, if larger than 1 then false
        odd = 0
        for value in counter:
            if value%2!=0:
                odd += 1
        return odd<=1

    def dfs(self, root, counter):
        if not root:
            return 0
        # counter[root.val] = counter.get(root.val, 0)+1
        # the number of root.val plus
        counter[root.val] += 1
        # res is used to record the number of paths
        res = 0
        # when leaf point judge
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            if self.isPseudoPalindromic(counter):
                res = 1
        # the number of current path is subpath of left and right
        else:
            res = self.dfs(root.left, counter) + self.dfs(root.right, counter)
        # backwar
        counter[root.val] -= 1
        return res
```
