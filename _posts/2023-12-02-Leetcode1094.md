[1094 Car Pooling](https://leetcode.cn/problems/car-pooling/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about Hash.

#### 1.Simple

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        # 最后下车的车站
        End = max(trip[2] for trip in trips)
        # change用于存储每站乘客的数量变化（下车之后）
        change = [0] * (End+1)
        # 按照上车顺序排序？
        trips = sorted(trips, key=lambda x:x[1])
        for trip in trips:
            change[trip[1]] += trip[0]
            change[trip[2]] -= trip[0]
        # count is used to record current number of people
        count = 0
        for i in range(End+1):
            count += change[i]
            if count > capacity:
                return False
        return True
```

To be honest, I did not solve the problem by myself, but my though is the same as answer. First use a list to record change on every station, I simply want to use list to simulate the station, however, it need to update all the last stations after current one.

The answer use a list to record the change on each station and traverse all stations, update number of people on every station.
