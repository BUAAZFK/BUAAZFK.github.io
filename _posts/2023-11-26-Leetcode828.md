This is a problem from Leetcode which is about Hash.

#### 1.Hash

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s: str) -> int:
        index = collections.defaultdict(list)
        # index is used to record positions of each char
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            index[c].append(i)

        res = 0
        for arr in index.values():
            # padding the position with -1 and len(s)
            # using the probable position of start and end to compute
            arr = [-1] + arr + [len(s)]
            for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):
                # probable start is current index minus
                res += (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * (arr[i + 1] - arr[i])
        return res
