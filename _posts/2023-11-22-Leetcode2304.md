[2304 Minimum Path Cost in a Grid](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-path-cost-in-a-grid/)



This is a problem from Leetcode which is about DP.

#### 1.DP

```python
class Solution:
    def minPathCost(self, grid: List[List[int]], moveCost: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        row, col = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        dp = grid[0]
        for i in range(1, row):
            dp = [grid[i][j] + min(dp[k]+moveCost[grid[i-1][k]][j] for k in range(col))for j in range(col)]
        return min(dp)
```

Each `i`, update the dp as the minimum cost from the first row to current row(`i`) on each column. 

And the principle for updating is that traverse columns on current row, and the minimum cost equals to value of current block plus the minimum cost from last row to this block.(DP)
